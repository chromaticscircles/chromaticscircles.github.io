  <h2>About the Artist</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Deepti Padmanabha</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I started my mandala journey during the lockdown period of the COVID-19
    pandemic, purely out of curiosity and the thought of learning a new art.
    With more time on my hands at home, I decided to explore mandalas as a hobby.
  </p>

  <p>
    I began with simple designs, gradually understanding the importance of
    patterns and symmetry required to create balance. Often, I would start a
    piece around 11:00 pm and continue working through the night until 3:00 am,
    fully immersed in the design taking shape.
  </p>

  <p>
    As my passion grew, I started exploring dot mandalas and later expanded my
    practice to include Lippan art. Sleepless nights, complete focus on a single
    artwork, and the appreciation I received for my work kept motivating me and
    shaped what my art has become today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, this slow and mindful learning transformed into a deeply
    fulfilling creative journey. Along the way, I sold some of my artworks and
    donated the proceeds to Rotary RajMahal Vilas.
  </p>

  <p>
    At present, I am working on a round canvas measuring approximately 23 inches
    — something that once felt impossible but has now become a reality created
    with my whole heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reflecting on this journey, I see how curiosity gradually turned into
    confidence, and a simple interest evolved into a meaningful form of artistic
    expression that continues to keep me engaged and inspired.
  </p>

        It feels like just yesterday that Deepti created her very first mandala
        and swept us all off our feet. Since then, her art has continuously
        evolved—growing more intricate, complex, and beautifully detailed with
        time. Today, she creates expansive 23-inch designs with remarkable grace,
        passion, and intention.
